**How would you describe the issue?**

<!--
Give us short description of the issue, just to understand some context without
diving too deep into it.

If you can provide a code sample, regardless of the language, we'll be grateful.
It simplifies the debugging process a lot when we know how to trigger an invalid
behavior.
-->

**What are the expected results?**

<!--
Understanding your expectations helps us to improve the codebase in a correct
way. We're all people, we can see things in a different way.
-->

**What are the actual results?**

<!--
It's easier to focus efforts if we can easily compare expectations with reality.
-->

**How much does it hurt?**

The better we understand you, the better we can help. Your input will help us
prioritise the bugfix correctly.
